## Setup with intellij is weird

1. Powershell has a wget command that is different for the one required
2. Maven install has issues with unusual path names
   - ``C://user/test /``
   - ``C://user/test/Projects (Uni)``
3. MacOs requires workaround for ``java`` command because of insufficient permissions `sudo` is required
